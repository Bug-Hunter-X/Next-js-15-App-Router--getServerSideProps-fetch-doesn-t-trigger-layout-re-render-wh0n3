In Next.js 15, the App Router's use of `fetch` within the `getServerSideProps` function can lead to unexpected behavior.  If `fetch` is used to retrieve data that dynamically determines the page's layout, any change to that layout after the initial render will not trigger a re-render or reflect the correct data. This is because `getServerSideProps` runs only on the server-side during the initial request. Subsequent layout changes won't trigger another call to `getServerSideProps`. This might lead to inconsistencies between data fetched and the rendered layout, particularly if your data defines components or sections of your layout.
